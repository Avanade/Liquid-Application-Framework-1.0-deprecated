# Enter Liquid ![CI Badge](https://github.com/Avanade/Liquid-Application-Framework/workflows/CI/badge.svg)
Liquid is a **multi-cloud** framework designed to **accelerate the development** of cloud-native microservices while avoiding coupling your code to specific cloud providers. 

When writing Liquid applications, you stop worrying about the technology and focus on your business - Liquid abstracts most of the boilerplate and let you just write domain code that looks great and gets the job done.

## Features

- Abstracts a number of services from cloud providers such as Azure, AWS and Google Cloud to enable you to write code that will run anywhere.
- Brings a directed programming model that will save you time on thinking how to structure your application, allowing you to focus on writing business code.

# Getting Started

To use Liquid, you create a new base ASP.Net application and then download and install the following nuget packages:

- Liquid.Base
- LiquidApplication.Activation
- LiquidApplication.Domain
- LiquidApplication.Middleware
- LiquidApplication.Repository
- LiquidApplication.Runtime

And then choose what implementation cartridge you need to run your environment:

- If you'll deploy your application to Azure, install `LiquidApplication.OnAzure`
- If you'll deploy your application to Google, install `LiquidApplication.OnGoogle`
- If you'll deploy your application to AWS, install `LiquidApplication.OnAWS`

# Contribute
Some of the best ways to contribute are to try things out, file issues, and make pull-requests.

- You can provide feedback by filing issues on GitHub. We accept issues, ideas and questions. 
- You can contribute by creating pull requests for the issues that are listed. Look for issues marked as _good first issue_ if you are new to the project.
